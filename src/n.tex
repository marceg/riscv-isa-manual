\chapter{``N'' Standard Extension for User-Level Interrupts, Version 1.1}
\label{chap:n}

\begin{commentary}
  This is a placeholder for a more complete writeup of the N
  extension, and to form a basis for discussion.
\end{commentary}

This chapter presents a proposal for adding RISC-V user-level
interrupt and exception handling.  When the N extension is present,
and the outer execution environment has delegated designated
interrupts and exceptions to user-level, then hardware can transfer
control directly to a user-level trap handler without invoking the
outer execution environment.

\begin{commentary}
User-level interrupts were originally primarily intended to support secure
embedded systems with only M-mode and U-mode present.  In retrospect,
such systems are better served by hardwiring {\tt satp} to zero with
M-mode, S-mode and U-mode all present.  User-level interrupts can also be
supported in systems running Unix-like operating systems to support
user-level trap handling.

When used in an Unix environment, the user-level interrupts would
likely not replace conventional signal handling, but could be used as
a building block for further extensions that generate user-level
events such as garbage collection barriers, integer overflow,
floating-point traps.

\section{Additional CSRs}

The user-visible CSRs added to support the N extension are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:ncsrs}.

\section{User Status Register ({\tt ustatus})}

The {\tt ustatus} register is an XLEN-bit read/write register
formatted as shown in Figure~\ref{ustatusreg}.  The {\tt ustatus}
register keeps track of and controls the hart's current operating
state.

\end{figure*}

The user interrupt-enable bit UIE disables user-level interrupts when
clear. The value of UIE is copied into UPIE when a user-level trap is
taken, and the value of UIE is set to zero to provide atomicity for
the user-level trap handler.

\begin{commentary}
  There is no UPP bit to hold the previous privilege mode as it can
  only be user mode.
\end{commentary}

The URET instructions is used to return from traps in U-mode, and URET
copies UPIE into UIE, then sets UPIE.
\begin{commentary}
  UPIE is set after the UPIE/UIE stack is popped to enable interrupts
  and help catch coding errors.
\end{commentary}

\section{Other CSRs}
The remaining CSRs function in an analogous way to the trap handling
registers defined for M-mode and S-mode.

\section{N Extension Instructions}

The URET instruction is added to perform the analogous function to
MRET and SRET.

\section{Reducing Context-Swap Overhead}

The user-level interrupt-handling registers add considerable state to
the user-level context, yet will usually rarely be active in normal
use.  In particular, {\tt uepc}, {\tt ucause}, and {\tt utval} are
only valid during execution of a trap handler.

An NS field can be added to {\tt mstatus} and {\tt sstatus} following
the format of the FS and XS fields to reduce context-switch overhead
when the values are not live.  Execution of URET will place the {\tt
  uepc}, {\tt ucause}, and {\tt utval} back into initial state.
